With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?\n\nIn this project, you'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. You'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.\n\nYour search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. You'll also filter, group, and order data. Make sure you brush up on these skills before trying this project! The database contains two tables. Each table has been limited to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on Kaggle.\n\n### `game_sales` table\n\n| Column | Definition | Data Type |\n|-|-|-|  \n|name|Name of the video game|`varchar`|\n|platform|Gaming platform|`varchar`|\n|publisher|Game publisher|`varchar`|\n|developer|Game developer|`varchar`|\n|games_sold|Number of copies sold (millions)|`float`|\n|year|Release year|`int`|\n\n### `reviews` table\n\n| Column | Definition | Data Type |\n|-|-|-|\n|name|Name of the video game|`varchar`|  \n|critic_score|Critic score according to Metacritic|`float`|\n|user_score|User score according to Metacritic|`float`|\n\n\n### `users_avg_year_rating` table\n\n| Column | Definition | Data Type |\n|-|-|-|\n|year| Release year of the games reviewed |`int`|  \n|num_games| Number of games released that year |`int`|\n|avg_user_score| Average score of all the games ratings for the year |`float`|\n\n### `critics_avg_year_rating` table\n\n| Column | Definition | Data Type |\n|-|-|-|\n|year| Release year of the games reviewed |`int`|  \n|num_games| Number of games released that year |`int`|\n|avg_critic_score| Average score of all the games ratings for the year |`float`|\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"35d4e17b-eeb6-40dd-a140-7b949390e115","cell_type":"markdown","attachments":{}},{"source":"-- Top 10 best selling Nintendo games in 2005-2010\n\nSELECT *\nFROM game_sales\nWHERE year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2010 \n\tAND publisher = 'Nintendo'\nORDER BY games_sold DESC\nLIMIT 10;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"best_selling_games","sqlCellMode":"query","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","integrationType":"postgresql","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":999,"lastExecutedAt":1718824768203,"lastExecutedByKernel":"f5951327-2948-4fa6-b9ad-a2e134b3c53c","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"-- top 10 best selling Nintendo games in 2005-2010\nSELECT *\nFROM game_sales\nWHERE year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2010 \n\tAND publisher = 'Nintendo'\nORDER BY games_sold DESC\nLIMIT 10;","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":305,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"id":"1216acd5-e067-4582-be43-23907fce4bf3","cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"name","type":"string"},{"name":"platform","type":"string"},{"name":"publisher","type":"string"},{"name":"developer","type":"string"},{"name":"games_sold","type":"number"},{"name":"year","type":"integer"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"name":["Wii Sports for Wii","Mario Kart Wii for Wii","Wii Sports Resort for Wii","New Super Mario Bros. for DS","New Super Mario Bros.
